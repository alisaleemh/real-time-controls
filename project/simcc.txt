The following installation instructions assume the use of zsh.


1. Go to your home directory, and create a directory called "bin" (if it
   does not already exist), i.e.
	
	cd
	mkdir bin

2. Go into the bin directory by entering the command:

	cd ~/bin

3. Open your web browser and download the script file "simcc.script" from the course's
   web site to the ~/bin directory.

4. Rename the script file "simcc.script" to "simcc" and make it executable by entering the command:
   
        mv simcc.script simcc
	chmod u+x simcc

5. Add the "bin" directory to your search path, i.e.

	export PATH=~/bin:$PATH

6. You can now compile you programs using simcc, e.g.

	simcc projectA.c
